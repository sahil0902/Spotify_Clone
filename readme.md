# Spotify Clone Web Player Homepage

This project is a static clone of the Spotify Web Player homepage. It has been recreated using HTML and CSS to mimic the look and feel of Spotify's own web service. This clone does not feature actual music playback or interactive functionality.

## Features

- A navigation sidebar with placeholders for 'Home' and 'Search' links.
- A simulated library section with options to view 'Your Library' and placeholders for playlist and podcast browsing.
- A main content area featuring card components representing 'Recently Played', 'Trending Now', and 'Featured Charts' sections.
- A footer area that mimics the Spotify player's look, with placeholders for song information and playback controls.

## Installation

To view the Spotify clone homepage on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document with all the markup for the homepage.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that contains all the styles for the homepage.
- `assets/`: This directory holds all static resources like images and icons used in the project.
